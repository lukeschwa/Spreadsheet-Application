# Spreadsheet-Application
An Excel Spreadsheet like application

By Luke Schauble

Hello! This is my Spreadsheet applications meant to mimic some of the functions of microsoft excel.
There is also a demo of the logic used in creating functions.

Functions
1. Save and Load files
2. Redo and Undo Changes
3. Change Background Color of Cells
4. Execute functions using multiple cells by refrencing the cell (Checks for Circular and Bad Refrences)

Directions for Function Exection
1. You are able to set the value of multiple cells and refrence them in an function.
2. All functions start with an "=" and then the function of your choice.
3. If you've set the A1 cell to be 4, and the B3 cell to be 5, then in another cell, if you input "=A1+B3" You will get 9.

Available Operators
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Divition)
^ (Exponent)
() (Brackets)
